This repository delves into the application of SeisBench, a powerful Python toolbox, for various seismic analysis tasks using machine learning models. It serves as a platform for experimentation and learning with SeisBench's capabilities, potentially including

Earthquake Detection & Phase Picking: Utilizing SeisBench models to identify earthquakes and pinpoint seismic wave phases within recorded data.
Waveform Denoising: Experimenting with models to clean up seismic waveforms and improve signal quality.
Depth Estimation: Training and testing models for estimating the depth of earthquake sources.
Customization and Exploration: The repository can also be a hub for exploring other SeisBench functionalities and potentially developing new models for specific seismic analysis needs.
